- Make "GoHome" on lost comm link timeout configurable

- ground station sends up true date so gumstix can set it's clock properly

- have "home" location selection write an entry to debug.txt
- don't write FollowRoute to debug each time we receive a message.

- Add update rate (ahrs/nav/etc.) values to the health structure so the
  ground station can evaluate the performance of the onboard computer.

- Add an altitude estimator based on the pressure sensor, but
  corrected over time by an average of the (gps - pressure) error.

x Add return / command direction across serial connection.

x add config file

x Autopilot!

x 2/14/2007: Better libstdc++ solution on stargate (hate to static link) :-(
  - copy libstdc++.so.5.0.5 and libgcc_s.so.1 from build tree
  - then we can dynamically link the ugear executable so it is a small upload
    and it will run on the host.
  - Not sure what else might break when libgcc_s.so.1 is replaced with a
    newer version, so heads up and eyes open ...

x 2/13/2007: Port property system to the arm (?piggy?)

x 2/13/2007: Port xml reader to the arm (?piggy?)

x 2/12/2007: Make MNAV serial device selectable from the command line
